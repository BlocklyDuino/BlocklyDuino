### Welcome to BlocklyDuino.
BlocklyDuino is a web-based visual programming editor for [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/).

BlocklyDuino is based on [Blockly](http://code.google.com/p/blockly/), the web-based, graphical programming editor. Provide static type language blocks and code generators for arduino programming.

BlocklyDuino also support [Grove](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/GROVE_System) blocks to easily get started with microcontroller-based experimentation and learning.

[We also have Google+ Page](https://plus.google.com/111979846292233941175).

### Demo

BlocklyDuino is a web tool. You can give it a try at
[Link](http://www.gasolin.idv.tw/public/blockly/demos/blocklyduino/index.html) to see the working BlocklyDuino.

Or watch the [video demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swiyXcUvNY)

### Run locally on your web browser

If you want to install it locally. Get code from github and open blockly/demos/blocklyduino/index.html in your browser.

The preffered way is to put the BlocklyDuino/web folder into a web server and open the url like localhost/public/blockly/demos/blocklyduino/index.html for use.

### Usage (3 Step)

1. Open browser to BlocklyDuino, Drag and Drop blocks to make arduino program. 
2. Select 'Arduino' tab to copy source code to Arduino IDE
3. press 'upload' button to burn the code into arduino
