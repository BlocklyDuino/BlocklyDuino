### Welcome to ADHDuino

(BlocklyDuino README can be found in blockly/apps\blocklyduino/README.txt)

Specification:
- Python 2.7.18
- Arduino IDE version 1.8.19
- port COM5, Arduino UNO board.

(note: the index.html file was split into index.html, index.css and index.js to reduce clutter. Any new js or css files are in scripts and styles)

Simply opening the index.html file via directory or terminal (cd (whatever folder the zip is in)/ADHDuino/blockly/blocklyduino/index.html) should work.

To upload code to the Arduino, make sure it's port is COM5 and Arduino IDE is installed (and findable) and click the 'Upload' button. The code should now run.
