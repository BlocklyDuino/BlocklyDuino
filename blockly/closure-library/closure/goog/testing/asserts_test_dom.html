Temporary test DOM file that pulls in transpile.js to get Map and Set polyfills. This file is not
marked as ES6 in deps.js since it does not use ES6 syntax. However it does use ES6 libraries (Map +
Set), so it needs polyfills. We need to fix deps.js generation to mark this as ES6, or as some new
ES6-library language level.
